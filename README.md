My public stuff


I'm adding documentation over time. Broadly, the three folders define three categories:

AR Work is a pretty large set of sql queries from my last job as Deputy Data Director in Arkansas's coordinated campaign.

Work Shared with Colleagues is a sparser set, including some old scripts I didn't nessesarily use this cycle, but thought might be useful for others.

Best Of is completed projects of which I am very proud. At present it only includes work up to my last job before AR - I'll assemble work from the AR Work folder into Best Of as I get the chance to better document it.
