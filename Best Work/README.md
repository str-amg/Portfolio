Dialer Reports:
Once I made it, I ran this script every morning – it took the nightly exports from the dialer, uploaded them to a couple of master tables, and pulled a summary from those tables. The export was plugged into the “raw” sheet of “Dialer Report Summary,” which I’ve sent along for context only – that document predates me, I want to be clear that didn’t create it.

Recount:
I put this together when we were first looking at modeling the AG recount in VA. It serves as a timeline of the vote counts, by county, over the course of a 2008 recount in VA’s 5th US House District.

AfAm Undecided Hypothetical:
Going into the last couple of weeks, African Americans had a much higher portion of undecided voters in a down-ticket race. We wanted to see what would happen if the AfAm population was only as undecided as the rest of the population.

Staging Location Geocoder:
A python script I threw together to geocode staging locations.
